# House-Price-Prediction

This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as housing median age, number of bedrooms, population, and more. The goal is to use historical data to train the model and predict future house prices accurately.

1)Introduction:

House prices can fluctuate due to various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. By applying a Multiple Linear Regression model, we can estimate the price of a house based on these factors. This project explores this technique using a dataset of house prices and evaluates the performance of the model.

2)Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains information about houses, including:

Housing median age

Number of bedrooms

Population

Median income

Other relevant features

You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) or use any other suitable house price dataset.



3)Model:

The model used in this project is a Multiple Linear Regression model. It attempts to model the relationship between the dependent variable (house price) and multiple independent variables (house features).

The equation for multiple linear regression is:

y= B0+B1x1+B2x2+...+BnXn+ϵ

Where:

1)y is the predicted house price.

2)x1,x2,...,xn are the independent variables (features like ocean proximity, number of rooms, etc.)

3)B1,B2,..,Bn are the coefficients learned by the model.

4)ϵ is the error term.


4)Usage

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing/standardizing numerical features.

Train the Model: Train the multiple linear regression model, you can modify hyperparameters and evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Prediction: After training, use the model to predict house prices for new data.

5)Results:

The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

R-squared: A measure of how well the model explains the variability of the dependent variable.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

6)Future Work:

Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for better predictions.

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV.
